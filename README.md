# WECVD
Webcam-based eye-tracking dataset from CVD (Colour Vision Deficiency) subjects. 
12 subjects volounteered to participate in a webcam-based eye-tracking session. Half of participants are individuals with CVD (Colour Vision Deficiency) while the other half is with no-CVD subjects. 
Fourteen images were prompted to the screen for a time range of 5 seconds each. A one-second transition frame was shown to refresh viewers' retina and move to following images. On-screen eye movements of each participants were recorded. 
All images contain regions having red as the dominant colour. That is because of red being a colour dichromatic vision systems such as protanopic and deuteranopic ones struggle to perceive.
Those regions are inscribed into rectangular masks and defined as AOI (areas of interest). 
Differences between CVD and normal vision systems are saught by looking at percentages of fixation points in AOIs for each image within the same group. Inter group comparison gave the overall description of the case study. 
The hypothesis of CVD and normal vision system groups showing different paths over the first 3 seconds of observation was tested using one-way ANOVA. Results proved the statistical significance of the test with a p-value < 0.05
